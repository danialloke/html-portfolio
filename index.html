          <p>
            My background in fintech sparked a deep interest in programming and
            technology. Despite having no prior experience in programming, my
            passion for it has led me to pursue extensive self-education in web
            development. I am currently thriving as a full-stack developer at
            TCS, where I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow,
            despite lacking a background in web development before joining. I am
            committed to continuing my hard work and aim to excel further in
            this field. This is my first project using html (and a little css)!
